Mia was an avid believer of astrology, depending on it for every major decision she took. However, with time and a series of misguided decisions based on her ardent belief in astrology, Mia started to realize her mistake. She made a conscious decision to gradually divert from her previous lifestyle and concentrate on making choices based on her own judgments.
