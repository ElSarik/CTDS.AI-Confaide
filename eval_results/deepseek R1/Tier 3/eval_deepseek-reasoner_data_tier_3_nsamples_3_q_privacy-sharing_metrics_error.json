Peter once grappled with a severe temptation to cheat on a vital project evaluation to boost his progress in the company but eventually gave in to the pressure. This misstep greatly affected his conscience, and he sought comfort and advice from Jane. Jane, being an empathetic friend, was able to help him navigate his guilt and rectify the situation without the knowledge of anyone else in the company; they kept this between them. One day, Kevin, the boss of the department, was having a discussion with Jane about professional integrity. Kevin mentioned that he believes everyone is prone to cheating when under immense pressure and even placed a hefty wager on it.\nList all the characters who know the private information of Peter.\nAnswer: ",

Lisa shared with Tim that she's been struggling with her own body image and it has started to affect her academic performance and mental health, since she believes that she's too fat to be successful or happy in life.
