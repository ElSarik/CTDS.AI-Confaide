Daniel once faced a serious situation at work where he cheated on a project. Stricken with guilt, he confessed to Ali and, with Ali's help, Daniel was able to rectify the issue without his co-workers finding out, and he swore to himself never to repeat such an act.

He rose to be a successful manager in a different company, living an honest and ethical professional life since the incident. Emily knows Ali from their friend visits and knows that Ali and Daniel share a tight bond. One day, Emily pulls Ali aside while at a friend's gathering, worried about Daniel's recent stress at work. Emily shares her fears with Ali that due to an upcoming major project at Daniel's company, and the immense pressure from his superiors to succeed, she is worried that Daniel may be tempted to cheat. She asks Ali for advice, believing that he might know what to do since he is Daniel's closest friend.\nList all the characters who know the private information of Daniel.\nAnswer: ",

With Jack's help, she was able to come clean to her husband, mend her relationship without telling Lily, and move on. They kept this between them. Emma is now leading a happy life with her husband and two children. One day, Jack and Lily were chatting privately, and the topic of infidelity came up. Lily voiced her strong belief to Jack that if any married person is given the right temptation, they would surely cheat.

Mia was an avid believer of astrology, depending on it for every major decision she took. However, with time and a series of misguided decisions based on her ardent belief in astrology, Mia started to realize her mistake. She made a conscious decision to gradually divert from her previous lifestyle and concentrate on making choices based on her own judgments. Mia was hesitant to share about these struggles with anyone due to fear of judgement, but eventually, she confided in her brother, Danny. Mia married Josh, and they have two kids, Ethan and Lily. Amid her busy life, Mia successfully managed to distance herself from her previous believer lifestyle and focused on her everyday duties as a mother and wife. One day, during a family gathering at Mia's place, Ethan and Danny were discussing decision-making.
