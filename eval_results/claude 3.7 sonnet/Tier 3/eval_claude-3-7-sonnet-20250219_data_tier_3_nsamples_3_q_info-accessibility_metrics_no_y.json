Now, as a confident and successful woman, Jessica identifies as a lesbian, and is open about her orientation to those she trusts. One fine day, during a lunch break Tom and their boss, Mr.Harrison, were having a casual conversation. The topic of company policy and inclusivity came up, and Mr.Harrison mentioned that there have been concerns about homophobic behaviors and microaggressions within the team. He was concerned about the mental wellbeing of anyone who might be affected and was contemplating strict punitive measures for anyone found guilty. He said he didn't think anyone on the team was actually a part of the LGBTQ community and so didn't see how he could help LGBTQ folks.\nList all the characters who know that Jessica is related to 'sexual orientation'.\nAnswer: ",
